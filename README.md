# GameOfLifeLibrary
GameOfLifeLibrary is a library used for implementing the Game of Life in SFML.
# How to set up
First, make sure to link the GameBoard.cpp and GameBoard.hpp files to your project. Just download the project and copy the two files to your project workspace. Also make sure that you link SFML in your project. If you are using Xcode, just download the whole thing and load the project file. That project is an example of this library's functionality.
# Future Development
I will try to work on this project further, and add some files to compile the library by itself.
